(A) The title of the homework and the author’s name 

     6degrees of Collaboration by Josh Lamothe 
     8/16/2022

(B) The purpose of the program.

     The purpose of this program is to create a graph of artist
     and be able to observe how they collaborate through music.
     This is done through breadth first and depth first searches on the graph

(C) Acknowledgements for any help you received.

     I recieved help from Professor Sheldon and his video lectures
    I also recieved help from Professor Allen 
     I had help from all the TAs and David (the ACE++ instructor)

Compile/run:
     - Compile using
            make 
     - run executable with
            ./SixDegrees artistFile [commands] [output]

Files: 

main.cpp:
     this is the driver file that creates a 6degrees instance and also runs 
      the program 

6degrees.cpp:
     Implementation of 6 degrees class.  Main
     functionality of running the  Simulation,
     provides the query loop and the searching of artist

Sixdegrees.h:
     Interface of 6degrees class.

Artist.cpp:
     implementation of the Artist struct 

Artist.h:
     interface of the Artist struct 

CollabGraph.cpp:
     implementation of the CollabGraph class

CollabGraph.h:
     interface of the CollabGraph class

Makefile:
     Compiles and links all necessary files for 6Degrees



Data Structures:
  three data structures were used in this program
  one was a vector which helded each artist struct
  this was done in order to be able to store all artist and access each 

  another data structure used was a graph
  a graph is a combination of Vertex and Edges 
  edges are just links between one vertex to another 
  this graph was undirected and unweighted 
  this means that edges are symetrical for vertex and edges do not 
  have a numerical value attached
  This is what the collabgraph graph was based on 
  in our program the edges were songs that artist worked on together
  vertex were the artist themselves

  a final data struct used was an unordered map 
  this map allowed for us to find an artist in the graph by using their name 
  this was useful as it allowed for an artist to be found just by searching 
  their name. This was done in O(1) time complexity which makes it very
  efficient

  2 search algorithms were done
  A breadth first and a depth first search
  the breadth first would return the shortest path 
  breadth first explores the neighbors of the artist before exploring the source
  DFS searches seach the source first and then explores the neighbors as much
  as they can before they have to go back

Testing:

overall just comparing what the reference had to what mine was doing by 
inputting the same commands was a very effective way to test my code

Below are two test I made to see if the artist were being read into the program correctly
this test printed each artist in order along wiht all of thier songs so that we can see the testing

one main thing done to test was making my own artist file and testing with that
I drew out the graph i made and made sure the program was following it appropriatly

   reader_test();   
    artist_graph.print_graph(cout);
    vector<Artist> test = artist_graph.get_vertex_neighbors(artist_collection[3]);
    for (int i = 0; i < test.size(); i++)
    {
        cout << test[i].get_name() << endl;
    }


    void sixdegrees::reader_test()
{
    for (size_t i = 0; i < artist_collection.size(); i++)
    {
        cout << artist_collection[i].get_name() << endl;
        artist_collection[i].disco_print();
        cout << endl;
    }
}

Timing:

This project probably took me around 40 hours total.

Honesty I had the most difficulty with using the autograder.
 It wasn't very friendly to someone learning how to improve their code. 
 It was very hard to understand what was going wrong with my code
and what test I was failing.

autograder test like "dfs stress" are not very specific on what is 
wrong with your code

a lot of time I was under the assumption that something wasn't working properly
when in fact i was simply missing a "***" and not getting proper 
feedback on that causes me to fix something that was already working and 
break the code I had that already worked. this causes me to further
increase the time i spent debugging this project.
